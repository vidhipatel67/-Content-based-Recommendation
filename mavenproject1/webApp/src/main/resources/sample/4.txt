text:Polymorphism: The ability to treat objects of different types in a similar manner.Example: Giraffe and Crocodile are both Animals, and animals can Move.If you have an instance of an Animal then you can call Move without knowing or caring what type of animal it is.Inheritance: This is one way of achieving both Polymorphism and code reuse at the same time.Other forms of polymorphism:There are other way of achieving polymorphism, such as interfaces, which provide only polymorphism but no code reuse (sometimes the code is quite different, such as Move for a Snake would be quite different from Move for a Dog, in which case an Interface would be the better polymorphic choice in this case.In other dynamic languages polymorphism can be achieved with Duck Typing, which is the classes don't even need to share the same base class or interface, they just need a method with the same name.Or even more dynamic like Javascript, you don't even need classes at all, just an object with the same method name can be used polymorphically.
