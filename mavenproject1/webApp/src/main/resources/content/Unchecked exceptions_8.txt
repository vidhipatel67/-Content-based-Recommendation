<p>Runtime exceptions are usually caused by data errors, like arithmetic overflow, divide by zero, ... . Runtime exceptions are not business related exceptions. In a well debugged code, runtime exceptions should not occur. Runtime exceptions should only be used in the case that the exception could be thrown by and only by something hard-coded into the program. These should not be able to be triggered by the software's user(s).</p>
