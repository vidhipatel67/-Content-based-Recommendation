<p>This case is more simple as we can put all the data in the stream at the same time. The first part of the code generate a string containing the current time. Then we create a <code>File</code> object identifying the output file and an output stream for this file. We write the data in the stream, flush it and close it. That's all. No try/catch block has been defined for readability but the thrown exceptions should be caught.</p>
