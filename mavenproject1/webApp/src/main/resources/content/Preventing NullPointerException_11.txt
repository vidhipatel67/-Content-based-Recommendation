<p>This list is not complete — there are no rules for preventing <code>NullPointerException</code> entirely in Java, because the standard libraries have to be used, and they can cause <code>NullPointerException</code>s. Also, it is possible to observe an uninitialized final field in Java, so you can't even treat a final field as being completely trusted during the object's creation.</p>
