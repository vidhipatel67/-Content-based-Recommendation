<p>The variables we studied so far had a mixed case. When there are two or more words making up the names of a variable, you need to use a special case called the <i>camel-case</i>. Just like the humps of a camel, your words need to stand out. Using this technique, the words <code>first</code> and <code>name</code> could be written as either <code>firstName</code> or <code>FirstName</code>.</p>
