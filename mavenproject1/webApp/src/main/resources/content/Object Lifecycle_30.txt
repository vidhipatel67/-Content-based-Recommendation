<p>When an object is garbage-collected, the programmer may want to manually perform cleanup, such as closing any open input/output streams. To accomplish this, the <code>finalize()</code> method is used. Note that <code>finalize()</code> should never be manually called, except to call a super class' finalize method from a derived class' finalize method. Also, we can not rely on when the <code>finalize()</code> method will be called. If the java application exits before the object is garbage-collected, the <code>finalize()</code> method may never be called.</p>
