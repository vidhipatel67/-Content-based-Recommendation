<p>The first two statements are pretty much similar to those in <a href="#section-3">Section 3.3</a> but with different variable names. The third however is a bit interesting. We've already talked of variables as being similar to gift boxes. Think of your computer's memory as a shelf where you put all those boxes. Whenever you need a box (or variable), you call its identifier (that's the name of the variable). So calling the variable identifier <code>firstNumber</code> gives you the number <code>10</code>, calling <code>secondNumber</code> would give you <code>20</code> hence when you add the two up, the answer should be <code>30</code>. That's what the value of the last variable <code>result</code> would be. The part of the third statement where you add the numbers, i.e., <code>firstNumber + secondNumber</code> is called an <b>expression</b> and the expression is what decides what the value is to be. If it's just a plain value, like in the first two statements, then it's called a <b>literal</b> (the value is <i>literally</i> the value, hence the name <i>literal</i>).</p>
