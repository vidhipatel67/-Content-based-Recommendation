<p>That's it! Our first ever annotation has been defined. Now, we can use it with any of our classes. An annotation definition if you look closely resembles the definition of a normal interface, except that the <code>interface</code> keyword is preceded by the <b><code>@</code></b> character. Some refer to this syntactical declaration as the <i><b>annotation type declaration</b></i> due to the fact that @ is 'AT' or 'Annotation Type' for that very instance.</p>
