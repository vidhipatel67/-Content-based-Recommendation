<p>While it may seem convenient, it may cause problems if you make a typographical error. For example, if you use the above import to use JFrame, but then type <code>JFraim frame = new JFraim();</code>, the Java compiler will report an error similar to "Cannot find symbol: JFraim". Even though it seems as if it was imported, the compiler is giving the error report at the first mention of JFraim, which is half-way through your code, instead of the point where you imported JFrame along with everything else in javax.swing.</p>
