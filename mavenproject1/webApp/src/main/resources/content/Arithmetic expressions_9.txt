<p>The division operator rounds towards zero: <code>5/2</code> is 2, and <code>-5/2</code> is -2. The remainder operator has the same sign as the left operand; it is defined such that <code>((a/b)*b) + (a%b)</code> is always equal to a. The preincrement, predecrement, postincrement, and postdecrement operators are special: they also change the value of the variable, by adding or subtracting one. The only difference is that preincrement/decrement returns the new value of the variable; postincrement returns the original value of the variable.</p>
