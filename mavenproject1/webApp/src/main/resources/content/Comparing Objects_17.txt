<p>The natural ordering for a class C is said to be consistent with equals if and only if <code>e1.compareTo((Object) e2) == 0</code> has the same boolean value as <code>e1.equals((Object) e2)</code> for every e1 and e2 of class C. Note that null is not an instance of any class, and <code>e.compareTo(null)</code> should throw a NullPointerException even though <code>e.equals(null)</code> returns false.</p>
