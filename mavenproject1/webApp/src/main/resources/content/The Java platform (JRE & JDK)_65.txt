<p>There are cases where you might want to program using a different language (say, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)" class="extiw" title="w:Python (programming language)">Python</a>) and yet be able to generate Java byte-code (instead of the Python compiled code) to be run with the JVM. Many third-party programming language vendors provide compilers that can compile code written in their language to Java byte-code. For instance, Python developers can use <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jython" class="extiw" title="w:Jython">Jython</a> compilers to compile Python code to the Java byte-code format (<i>as illustrated below</i>).</p>
