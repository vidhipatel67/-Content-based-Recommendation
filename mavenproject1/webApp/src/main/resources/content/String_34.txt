<p>As <code>StringBuilder</code> isn't thread safe (see the chapter on <a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Concurrent_Programming" title="Java Programming/Concurrent Programming">Concurrency</a>). You can't use it in more than one thread. For multi-thread environment, use <code>StringBuffer</code> instead, which does the same and is thread safe. However, as <code>StringBuffer</code> is slower, so only use it when it is required. Moreover, only <code>StringBuffer</code> existed before Java 5.</p>
