<p>JavaBeans interact with each other by means of <i>events</i>. Events are notifications, a component can give to other components, that something interesting has happened. An example for an event might be a mouse click on a button or the closing of a window. Beans can be source and target of events. To be informed about an event, a bean has to register at another Bean as a <i>listener</i>.</p>
