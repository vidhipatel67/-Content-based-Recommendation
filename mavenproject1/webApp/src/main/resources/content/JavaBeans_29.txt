<p>A big strength of the JavaBean component model is that it is designed for simplicity. Developing JavaBeans is very simple, because a lot of behavior (like the platform independence or packaging mechanism) is supported in the Java Programming Language by default. However, one can optionally equip beans with additional objects like <i>BeanInfos</i> or custom <i>PropertyEditors</i> to use the component model in a more flexible way. A second facility is that Sun designed the whole Swing GUI library according to the JavaBeans component model. Thereby Swing components can easily be composed in visual builder tools.</p>
