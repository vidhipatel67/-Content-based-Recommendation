<p>This statement allows the thread executing the current runnable block to halt its execution for the given amount of time. This time is presented in milliseconds. But for our convenience, this time would be the random number generated in the constructor and can be anywhere between <code>0</code> and <code>999</code> milliseconds. We will explore this in a later section. Creating a <code>Runnable</code> process block is just the beginning. No code is actually executed. To do so, we would require the creation of threads that would then individually execute this task.</p>
