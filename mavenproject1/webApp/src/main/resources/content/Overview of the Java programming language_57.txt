<p>In most people's opinions, Java technology delivers reasonably well on all these goals. The language is not, however, without drawbacks. Java tends to be more high-level than similar languages (such as C++), which means that the Java language lacks features such as hardware-specific data types, low-level pointers to arbitrary memory addresses, or programming methods like operator overloading. Although these features are frequently abused or misused by programmers, they are also powerful tools. However, Java technology includes <a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Java_Native_Interface" title="Java Programming/Java Native Interface">Java Native Interface</a> (JNI), a way to call native code from Java language code. With JNI, it is still possible to use some of these features.</p>
