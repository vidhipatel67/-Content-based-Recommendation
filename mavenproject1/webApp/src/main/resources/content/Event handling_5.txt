<p>No matter what the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/programming_language" class="extiw" title="w:programming language">programming language</a> or <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm" class="extiw" title="w:Programming paradigm">paradigm</a> you are using, chances are that you will eventually run into a situation where your program will have to wait for an external event to happen. Perhaps your program must wait for some user input, or perhaps it must wait for data to be delivered over the network. Or perhaps something else. In any case, the program must wait for something to happen that is beyond the program's control: the program cannot <i>make</i> that event happen.</p>
