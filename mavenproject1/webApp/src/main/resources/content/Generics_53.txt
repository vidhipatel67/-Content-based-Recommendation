<p>Java was long criticized for the need to explicitly type-cast an element when it was taken out of a "container/collection" class. There was no way to enforce that a "collection" class contains only one type of object (e.g., to forbid <i>at compile time</i> that an <code>Integer</code> object is added to a <code>Collection</code> that should only contain <code>String</code>s). This is possible since Java 1.5. In the first couple of years of Java evolution, Java did not have a real competitor. This has changed by the appearance of Microsoft C#. With Generics Java is better suited to compete against C#. Similar constructs to Java Generics exist in other languages, see <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming" class="extiw" title="w:Generic programming">Generic programming</a> for more information. Generics were added to the Java language syntax in version 1.5. This means that code using Generics will not compile with Java 1.4 and less. Use of generics is optional. For backwards compatibility with pre-Generics code, it is okay to use generic classes without the generics type specification (<code>&lt;T&gt;</code>). In such a case, when you retrieve an object reference from a generic object, you will have to manually cast it from type Object to the correct type.</p>
