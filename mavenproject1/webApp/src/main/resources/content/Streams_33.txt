<p><code>System.out</code> and <code>System.err</code> differ in what they're supposed to be used for. <code>System.out</code> should be used for normal program output, <code>System.err</code> should be used to inform the user that some kind of error has occurred in the program. In some situations, this may be important. In DOS, for instance, a user can redirect standard output to some other destination (a file, for example), but error output will not be redirected, but rather displayed on the screen. If this weren't the case, the user might never be able to tell that an error had occurred.</p>
