<p>There is no limit on how many objects from the same class can be created. Code and <code><a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Keywords/static" title="Java Programming/Keywords/static"><font style="color:DodgerBlue4; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">static</font></a></code> variables are stored only once, no matter how many objects are created. Memory is allocated for the object member variables when the object is created. Thus, the size of an object is determined not by its code's size but by the memory it needs for its member variables to be stored.</p>
