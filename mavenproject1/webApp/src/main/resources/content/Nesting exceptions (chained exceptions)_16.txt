<p>By convention, class <code>Throwable</code> and its subclasses have two constructors, one that takes no arguments and one that takes a String argument that can be used to produce a detail message. Further, those subclasses that might likely have a cause associated with them should have two more constructors, one that takes a <code>Throwable</code> (the cause), and one that takes a String (the detail message) and a <code>Throwable</code> (the cause).</p>
