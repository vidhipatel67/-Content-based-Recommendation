<p>With what we have learned so far, we will identify the different types of signed integer values that can be created and manipulated in Java. Following is a table of the most basic numeric types: integers. As we have discussed earlier, the data types in Java for integers caters to both positive and negative values and hence are <b>signed numeric types</b>. The size in bits for a numeric type determines what its minimum and maximum value would be. If in doubt, one can always calculate these values.</p>
