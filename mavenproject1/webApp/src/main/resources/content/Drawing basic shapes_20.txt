<p>For the purposes of bringing color to our drawing, we used a method namely the <code style="border-bottom:dashed green 1px;">setColor(Color)</code> method. This method comes into force for all the drawing made after its call until another color is set. It asks for an argument of type <code style="border-bottom:dashed red 1px;">Color</code>. Now because you have no idea of how to actually instantiate a <code style="border-bottom:dashed red 1px;">Color</code> class, the class itself has a few built-in colors. Some built-in colors that you can use are mentioned below.</p>
