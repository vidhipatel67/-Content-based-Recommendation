<p>In Java, there are several existing methods that already sort objects from any class like <code>Collections.sort(List&lt;T&gt; list)</code>. However, Java needs to know the comparison rules between two objects. So when you define a new class and want the objects of your class to be sortable, you have to implement the <code>Comparable</code> and redefine the <code>compareTo(Object obj)</code> method.</p>
