<p>In Java, numbers are dealt with using data types specially formulated to host numeric data. But before we dive into these types, we must first set some concepts in stone. Just like you did in high school (or even primary school), numbers in Java are placed in clearly distinct groups and systems. As you'd already know by now, number systems includes groups like the <i>integer</i> numbers (0, 1, 2 ... ?); <i>negative integers</i> (0, -1, -2 ... -?) or even <i>real</i> and <i>rational</i> numbers (<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi" class="extiw" title="w:Pi">value of Pi</a>, ¾, 0.333~, etcetera). Java simply tends to place these numbers in two distinct groups, <b>integers</b> (-? ... 0 ... ?) and <b>floating point</b> numbers (any number with decimal points or fractional representation). For the moment, we would only look into integer values as they are easier to understand and work with.</p>
