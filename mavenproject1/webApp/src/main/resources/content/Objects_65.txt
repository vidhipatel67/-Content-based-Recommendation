<p>The <code>java.lang.Object.notify()</code> and <code>java.lang.Object.notifyAll()</code> methods remove one or more threads from an object's wait list and add them to the set of executable threads. <code>notify</code> removes a single thread from the wait list, while <code>notifyAll</code> removes all threads from the wait list. Which thread is removed by <code>notify</code> is unspecified and dependent on the JVM implementation.</p>
