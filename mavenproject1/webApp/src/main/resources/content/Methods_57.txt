<p>The constructor is a special method called automatically when an object is created with the <code><a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Keywords/new" title="Java Programming/Keywords/new"><font style="color:DodgerBlue4; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">new</font></a></code> keyword. Constructor does not have a return value and its name is the same as the class name. Each class must have a constructor. If we do not define one, the compiler will create a default so called <b>empty constructor</b> automatically.</p>
