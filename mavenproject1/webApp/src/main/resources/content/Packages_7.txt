<p>If your class is declared in a package, say <code>business</code>, your class must be placed in a subfolder called <code>business</code> from the root of your application folder. This is how the compiler and the class loader find the Java files on the file system. You can declare your class in a subpackage, say <code>engine</code>. So the full package is <code>business.engine</code> and the class must be placed in a subsubfolder called <code>engine</code> in the subfolder <code>business</code> (not in a folder called <code>business.engine</code>).</p>
