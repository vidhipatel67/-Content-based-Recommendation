<p>Native Java applications are preserved in a special format called the <i><b><a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Byte_Code" title="Java Programming/Byte Code">byte-code</a></b></i>. Byte-code remains the same, no matter what hardware architecture, operating system, or software platform it is running under. On a file-system, Java byte-code resides in files that have the <code>.class</code> (also known as a <i><b>class file</b></i>) or the <code>.jar</code> (also known as a <i><b>Java archive</b></i>) extension. To run byte-code, the JRE comes with a special tool (appropriately named <b>java</b>).</p>
