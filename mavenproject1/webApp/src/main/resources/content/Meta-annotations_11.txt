<p>In this example, <code>Superclass</code> has been explicitly annotated with both <code>@ForEveryone</code> and <code>@JustForMe</code>. <code>Subclass</code> hasn't been explicitly marked with either one; however, it inherits <code>@ForEveryone</code> because the latter is annotated with <code>@Inherited</code>. <code>@JustForMe</code> isn't annotated, so it isn't inherited by <code>Subclass</code>.</p>
