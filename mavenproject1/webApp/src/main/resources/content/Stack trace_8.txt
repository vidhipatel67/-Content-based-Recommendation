<p>From Java 1.4, the stack trace is encapsulated into an array of a java class called <code>java.lang.StackTraceElement</code>. The stack trace element array returned by <code>Throwable.getStackTrace()</code> method. Each element represents a single stack frame. All stack frames except for the one at the top of the stack represent a method invocation. The frame at the top of the stack represents the execution point at which the stack trace was generated. Typically, this is the point at which the throwable corresponding to the stack trace was created.</p>
