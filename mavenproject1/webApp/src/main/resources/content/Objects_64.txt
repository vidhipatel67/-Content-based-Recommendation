<p>The <code>wait</code> method must be called inside of a block or method synchronized on the object. This insures that there are no race conditions between <code>wait</code> and <code>notify</code>. When the thread is placed in the wait list, the thread releases the object's mutex lock. After the thread is removed from the wait list and added to the set of executable threads, it must acquire the object's mutex lock before continuing execution.</p>
