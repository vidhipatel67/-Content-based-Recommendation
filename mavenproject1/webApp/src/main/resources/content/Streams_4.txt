<p><br> The most basic input and output in Java (<code>System.in</code> and <code>System.out</code> fields that have been used in the <a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Basic_IO" title="Java Programming/Basic IO">Basic I/O</a>) is done using streams. Streams are objects that represent sources and destinations of data. Streams that are sources of data can be read from, and streams that are destinations of data can be written to. A stream in Java is an ordered sequence of bytes of undetermined length. Streams are ordered and in sequence so that the java virtual machine can understand and work upon the stream. Streams are analogous to water streams. They exist as a communication medium, just like electromagnetic waves in communication. The order or sequence of bytes in a Java stream allow the virtual machine to classify it among other streams.</p>
