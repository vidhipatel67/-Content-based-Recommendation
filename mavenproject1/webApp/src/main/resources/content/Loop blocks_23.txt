<p>The <code><a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Keywords/for" title="Java Programming/Keywords/for"><font style="color:DodgerBlue4; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">for</font></a></code> loop is a specialized <code>while</code> loop whose syntax is designed for easy iteration through a sequence of numbers. It consists of the keyword <code>for</code> followed by three extra statements enclosed in parentheses. The first statement is the variable declaration statement, which allows you to declare one or more integer variables. The second is the condition, which is checked the same way as the <code>while</code> loop. Last is the iteration statement, which is used to increment or decrement variables, though any statement is allowed.</p>
