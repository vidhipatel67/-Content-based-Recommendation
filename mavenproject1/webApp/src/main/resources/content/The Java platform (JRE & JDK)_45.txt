<p>The task of writing such escape sequences is handled by <code>native2ascii</code>. You can write the international text in an editor using the appropriate character encoding, then use <code>native2ascii</code> to generate the necessary ASCII text with embedded Unicode escape sequences. Despite the name, <code>native2ascii</code> can also convert from ASCII to native, so it is useful for converting an existing properties file or resource bundle back to some other encoding.</p>
