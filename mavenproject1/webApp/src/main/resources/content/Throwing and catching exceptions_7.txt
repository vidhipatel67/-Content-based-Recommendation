<p>Such <i>exceptional code</i> that results in erroneous interpretations at program runtime usually results in errors that are called <i>exceptions</i> in Java. When the Java interpreter encounters an exceptional code, it halts execution and displays information about the error that occurs. This information is known as a <i>stack trace</i>. The <a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Stack_trace" title="Java Programming/Stack trace">stack trace</a> in the above example tells us more about the error, such as the thread — <code>"main"</code> — where the exception occurred, the type of exception — <code>java.lang.ArithmeticException</code>, a comprehensible display message — <code>/ by zero</code>, and the exact methods and the line numbers where the exception may have occurred.</p>
