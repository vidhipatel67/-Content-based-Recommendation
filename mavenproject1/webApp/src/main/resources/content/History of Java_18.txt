<p>Initially Java was owned by Sun Microsystems, but later it was released to open source; the term Java was a trademark of Sun Microsystems. Sun released the source code for its HotSpot Virtual Machine and compiler in November 2006, and most of the source code of the class library in May 2007. Some parts were missing because they were owned by third parties, not by Sun Microsystems. The released parts were published under the terms of the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License" class="extiw" title="w:GNU General Public License">GNU General Public License</a>, a free software license.</p>
