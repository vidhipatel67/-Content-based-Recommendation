<p>A <i><a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Methods#Special_method.2C_the_constructor" title="Java Programming/Methods">constructor</a></i> is a special method in a class which is used to construct an instance of the class. The constructor can perform initialization for the object, beyond that which the Java VM does automatically. For example, Java will automatically initialize the fields <code>point0</code> and <code>point1</code> to null.</p>
