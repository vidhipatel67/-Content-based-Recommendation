<p>The finalize method is required only if there are resources beyond the direct control of the Java Virtual Machine that needs to be cleaned up. In particular, there is no need to explicitly close an OutputStream, since the OutputStream will close itself when it gets finalized. Instead, the finalize method is used to release either native or remote resources controlled by the class.</p>
