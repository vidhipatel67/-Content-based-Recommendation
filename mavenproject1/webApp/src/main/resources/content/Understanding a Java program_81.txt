<p>Java supports <i><a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Arrays" title="Java Programming/Arrays">arrays</a></i>, which are aggregate types which have a fixed element type (which can be any Java type) and an integral size. This program uses only one array, <code>String[] args</code>. This indicates that <code>args</code> has an array type and that the element type is <code>String</code>. The Java VM constructs and initializes the array that is passed to the <code>main</code> method. See <i><a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Arrays" title="Java Programming/Arrays">arrays</a></i> for more details on how to create arrays and access their size.</p>
