<p>Building a Java application requires certain tasks to be performed defined in a <code>build.xml</code> file. Those tasks may include not only compiling the code, but also copying code, packaging the program to a Jar, creating EJBs, running automated tests, doing ftp for the code to remote site, and so on. For some tasks a condition can be assigned, for example to compile only changed code, or do the task if that was not already done so. Tasks dependency can also be specified, which will make sure that the order of executions of the tasks are in the right order. For example, when compiling the code before packaging it to a jar, the package-to-jar task depends on the compilation task.</p>
