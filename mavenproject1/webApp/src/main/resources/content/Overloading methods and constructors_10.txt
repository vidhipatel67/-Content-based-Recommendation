<p>Although both methods would be fit to call the method with the <code>String</code> parameter, it is the method with the nearest type that will be called instead. To be more accurate, it will call the method whose parameter type is a subclass of the parameter type of the other method. So, <code>aObject</code> will output <code>Object</code>. Beware! The parameter type is defined by the <i>declared</i> type of an object, <b>not</b> its <i>instantiated</i> type!</p>
