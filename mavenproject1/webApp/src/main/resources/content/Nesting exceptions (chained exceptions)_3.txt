<p><br> When an exception is caught, the exception contains the <a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Stack_trace" title="Java Programming/Stack trace">stack-trace</a>, which describes the error and shows where the exception happened, where the problem is, where the application programmer should look to fix the problem. Sometime it is desirable to catch an exception and throw another new exception. If the new exception keep a reference to the first exception, the first exception is called a <i>nesting exception</i>.</p>
