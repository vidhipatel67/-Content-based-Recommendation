<p>On the other hand, Java is also known as a <b>hybrid language</b>. While supporting <a href="/wiki/Object_Oriented_Programming" title="Object Oriented Programming">object oriented programming</a> (OOP), Java is not a pure OO language like <a href="/wiki/Programming:Smalltalk" title="Programming:Smalltalk" class="mw-redirect">Smalltalk</a> or <a href="/wiki/Ruby_Programming" title="Ruby Programming">Ruby</a>. Instead, Java offers both object types and <a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Primitive_Types" title="Java Programming/Primitive Types">primitive types</a>. Primitive types are used for boolean, character, and numeric values and operations. This allows relatively good performance when manipulating numeric data, at the expense of flexibility. For example, you cannot subclass the primitive types and add new operations to them.</p>
