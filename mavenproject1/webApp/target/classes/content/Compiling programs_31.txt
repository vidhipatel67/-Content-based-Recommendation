<p>Java programs often contain non-code files such as images and properties files. These are referred to generally as <i>resources</i> and stored in directories local to the classes in which they're used. For example, if the class <code>com.example.ExampleApp</code> uses the <code>icon.png</code> file, this file could be stored as <code>/com/example/resources/icon.png</code>. These resources present a problem when a program is complied, because <code>javac</code> does not copy them to wherever the <code>.class</code> files are being complied to (see above); it is up to the programmer to move the resource files and directories.</p>
