<p>People who do test-first programming or perform regression testing write a main() method in every Java class, and a <a href="/wiki/Python_Programming/Modules_and_how_to_use_them" title="Python Programming/Modules and how to use them">main() function in every Python module</a>, to run automated tests. When a person executes the file directly, the main() method executes and runs the automated tests for that file. When a person executes some other Java file that in turn imports many other Java classes, only one main() method is executed -- the main() method of the directly-executed file.</p>
