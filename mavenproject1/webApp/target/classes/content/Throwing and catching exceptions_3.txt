<p><br> Language compilers are adept at pointing out most of the erroneous code in a program, however there are some errors that only become apparent when the program is executed. Consider the <a href="#code-listing-1">code listing 6.1</a>; here, the program defines a method <b>divide</b> that does a simple division operation taking two integers as parameter arguments and returning the result of their division. It can safely be assumed that when the <b>divide(4, 2)</b> statement is called, it would return the number <b>2</b>. However, consider the next statement, where the program relies upon the provided command line arguments to generate a division operation. What if the user provides the number zero (<b>0</b>) as the second argument? We all know that division by zero is impossible, but the compiler couldn't possibly have anticipated the user providing zero as an argument.<br clear="all"></p>
