<p>Since version 1.2, the JRE features a more robust JVM. Instead of interpreting byte-code, it down-right converts the code straight into equivalent native code for the local system. This process of conversion is called <i><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/just-in-time_compilation" class="extiw" title="w:just-in-time compilation">just-in-time compilation</a></i> or <i>JIT-compilation</i>. This process only occurs when the byte-code is executed for the first time. Unless the byte-code itself is changed, the JVM uses the compiled version of the byte-code on every successive execution. Doing so saves a lot of time and processor effort, allowing applications to execute much faster at the cost of a <i>small</i> delay on first execution.</p>
