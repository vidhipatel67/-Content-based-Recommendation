<p>The reason for this diversion is that Java is not 100% object-oriented and discerns between "simple" and "complex" types. These will be handled in detail in the following sections. An example for a simple type is the <code>byte</code> type. An example for a complex type is a class. A subset of the complex types are classes that cannot be modified after creation, like a <code>String</code>, which is a concatenation of characters.</p>
