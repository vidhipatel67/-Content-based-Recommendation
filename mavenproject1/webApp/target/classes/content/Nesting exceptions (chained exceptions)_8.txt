<p>This is a kind of exception conversion, from one exception to another. For example, calling a remote object using RMI, the calling method has to deal with <code>RemoteException</code> which is thrown if something is wrong during the communication. For the application point of view, <code>RemoteException</code> has no meaning, it should be transparent to the application that a remote object was used or not. So the <code>RemoteException</code> should be converted to an application exception.</p>
