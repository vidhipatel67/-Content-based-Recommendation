<p>Objects passed in as parameters to the remote objects's methods will be passed by value. If the remote object changes the passed-in object values, it won't be reflected on the client side, this is opposite what happens when a local object is called. Objects that used as parameters for remote methods invocation must implement the <code>java.io.Serializable</code> interface, as they are going to be serialized when passed through the network, and a new object will be created on the other side.</p>
