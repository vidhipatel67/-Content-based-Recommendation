<p><i>Instance initializers</i> are blocks of code that are executed at the same time as initializers for instance (non-<code>static</code>) fields. Instance field initializers and instance initializers are executed in the order declared. Both instance initializers and instance field initializers are executed during the invocation of a constructor. The initializers are executed immediately after the superclass constructor and before the body of the constructor.</p>
