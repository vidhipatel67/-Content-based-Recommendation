<p>Up until now, you have been able to draw a simple rectangle for yourself while asking a question silently, "why is the outline of the rectangle being painted rather the area as a whole?" The answer is simple. Any method that starts with <code style="border-bottom:dashed green 1px;">drawXxxx(...)</code> only draws the outline. To paint the area within the outline, we use the <code style="border-bottom:dashed green 1px;">fillXxxx(...)</code> methods. For instance, the code below would fill a rectangle with yellow color while having a red outline. Notice that the arguments remain the same.</p>
