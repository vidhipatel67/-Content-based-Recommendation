<p>For a true component based application development we need to standardize the usage of a component. The client must somehow flexibly figure out automatically how to use a component, so component changes don't affect any of the clients using that component. Without that flexibility, a true component based application development will remain as an idea, a dream, a theory without significant practical use. If we had that flexibility, it could cause a paradigm shift in the software development industry.</p>
