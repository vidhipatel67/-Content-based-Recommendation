<p>Introduced in 1996 for the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_Operating_Environment" class="extiw" title="w:Solaris Operating Environment">Solaris</a>, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows" class="extiw" title="w:Microsoft Windows">Windows</a>, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS" class="extiw" title="w:Mac OS">Mac OS</a> Classic and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" class="extiw" title="w:Linux">Linux</a>, Java was initially released as the Java Development Kit 1.0 (JDK 1.0). This included the Java runtime (the virtual machine and the class libraries), and the development tools (e.g., the Java compiler). Later, Sun also provided a runtime-only package, called the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The first name stuck, however, so usually people refer to a particular version of Java by its JDK version (e.g., JDK 1.0).</p>
