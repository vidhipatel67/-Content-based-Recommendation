<p>It is all good, but this way, we can only host positive numbers (or unsigned integers). They are called <i>unsigned integers</i>. Unsigned integers are whole number values that are all positive and do not attribute to negative values. For this very reason, we would ask one of the 8 bits to hold information about the sign of the number (positive or negative). This leaves us with just 7 bits to actually count out a number. The maximum number that these 7 bits can hold (<code>1111111</code>) is <code>127</code> in the decimal system.</p>
