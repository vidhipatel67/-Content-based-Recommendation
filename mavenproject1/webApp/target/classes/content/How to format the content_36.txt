<p>This book uses various illustrations and diagrams to convey its message, e.g., flow-chart or UML diagrams, etc. Due to the nature of diagrams, they need to be designed in a scalable vector format. It is highly recommended that you use the SVG format for your diagrams. Please, do <i>not</i> use JPG or PNG for diagrams that could otherwise be done in SVG. Ask a regular contributor for his/her help in this matter.</p>
