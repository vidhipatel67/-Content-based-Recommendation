<p>The <code>java.lang.Object.equals(java.lang.Object)</code> method compares the object to another object and returns a <code>boolean</code> result indicating if the two objects are equal. Semantically, this method compares the contents of the objects whereas the equality comparison operator "<code>==</code>" compares the object references. The <code>equals</code> method is used by many of the data structure classes in the <code>java.util</code> package. Some of these data structure classes also rely on the <code>Object.hashCode</code> method—see the <code>hashCode</code> method for details on the contract between <code>equals</code> and <code>hashCode</code>. Implementing equals() isn't always as easy as it seems, see '<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.angelikalanger.com/Articles/JavaSolutions/SecretsOfEquals/Equals.html">Secrets of equals()</a>' for more information.</p>
