<p>The actual task that would be executed per this runnable block is presented within the <code>run()</code> method. To keep safe from exceptions occurring because of the concurrent programming, we wrap the code within this method with a <code>try..catch</code> block. The executing task actually consists of just three statements. The first outputs the provided name for the Runnable process, and the last reports that the thread has executed. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the code is the second statement: <code>Thread.sleep(...)</code>.</p>
