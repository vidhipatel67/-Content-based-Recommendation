<p>The blueprint that lets us build our sports car object is called a <i>class</i>. A class doesn't tell us how fast our sports car goes, or what color it is, but it does tell us that our sports car will have a field representing speed and color, and that they will be say, a number and a word (or hex color code), respectively. The class also lays out the methods for us, telling the car how to park and drive, but these methods can't take any action with just the blueprint — they need an object to have an effect.</p>
