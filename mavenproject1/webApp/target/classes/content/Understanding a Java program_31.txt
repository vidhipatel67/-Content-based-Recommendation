<p>This means that we are defining a class named <code>Distance</code>. Other classes, or in our case, the command line, can refer to the class by this name. The <code>public</code> keyword is an <a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Scope" title="Java Programming/Scope">access modifier</a> which declares that this class and its members may be accessed from other classes. The <code>class</code> keyword, obviously, identifies this declaration as a class. Java also allows declarations of <i><a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Interfaces" title="Java Programming/Interfaces">interfaces</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Annotations" title="Java Programming/Annotations">annotations</a></i>.</p>
