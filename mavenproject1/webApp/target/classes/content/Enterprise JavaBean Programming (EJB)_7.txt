<p>EJBs are an attempt to create component based application development. With EJBs it is easier to develop components, but the same basic and fundamental maintenance problem will still be there. That is the dependencies between the client and the components. The usage of a component is fixed, changes on the component interface cause to break the client code. The same client/server problem comes back, that is as the users of a component increases the maintenance of that component getting harder and harder until it goes to impossible.</p>
