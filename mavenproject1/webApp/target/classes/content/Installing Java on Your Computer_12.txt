<p>You can use your system's file search utilities to see if there is a <code>javac.exe</code> executable installed. If it is, and it is a recent enough version (Java 1.4.2 or Java 1.5, for example), you should put the <code>bin</code> directory that contains <code>javac</code> in your system path. The Java runtime, <code>java</code>, is often in the same <code>bin</code> directory.</p>
