<p>There are three overloaded versions of the <code>wait</code> method to support different ways to specify the timeout value: <code>java.lang.Object.wait()</code>, <code>java.lang.Object.wait(long)</code> and <code>java.lang.Object.wait(long, int)</code>. The first method uses a timeout value of zero (0), which means that the wait does not timeout; the second method takes the number of milliseconds as a timeout; the third method takes the number of nanoseconds as a timeout, calculated as <code>1000000 * timeout + nanos</code>.</p>
