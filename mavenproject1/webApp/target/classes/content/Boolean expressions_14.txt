<p>The boolean NOT operator ("!") inverts the value of a boolean expression. The boolean AND operator ("&amp;&amp;") will result in true if and only if the values on both sides of the operator are true. The boolean inclusive OR operator ("||") will result in true if either or both of the values on the sides of the operator is true. The boolean exclusive XOR operator ("^") will result in true if one and only of the values on the sides of the operator is true.</p>
