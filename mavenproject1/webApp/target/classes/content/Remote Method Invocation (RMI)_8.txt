<p>Remote objects can be listed in the RMI Registry. Clients can get a reference to the remote object by querying the Registry. After that, the client can call methods on the remote objects. (Remote object references can also be acquired by calling other remote methods. The Registry is really a 'bootstrap' that solves the problem of where to get the initial remote reference from.)</p>
