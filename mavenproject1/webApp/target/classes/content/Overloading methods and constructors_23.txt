<p>The <code>example1</code>, <code>example2</code> and <code>example3</code> methods will cause compile errors. The <code>example1</code> methods cannot co-exist because they have the same signature (remember, return type is <b>not</b> part of the signature). The <code>example2</code> methods cannot co-exist because the names of the parameters are not part of the signature. The <code>example3</code> methods cannot co-exist because the visibility of the methods are not part of the signature. The <code>example4</code> methods can co-exist, because they have different method signatures.</p>
