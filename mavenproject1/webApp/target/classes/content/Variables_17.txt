<p>Because we have provided a data type for the variable, we have a hint as to what the variable can and cannot hold. We know that <code>int</code> (integer) data type supports numbers that are either positive or negative integers. Therefore once a variable is created, we can provide it with any integer value using the following syntax. This process is called an <i>assignment operation</i>.</p>
