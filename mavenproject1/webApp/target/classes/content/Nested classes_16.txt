<p>In addition to instance variables of the enclosing class, local classes can also access local variables of the enclosing method, but only ones that are declared <code>final</code>. This is because the local class instance might outlive the invocation of the method, and so needs its own copy of the variable. To avoid problems with having two different copies of a mutable variable with the same name in the same scope, it is required to be <code>final</code>, so it cannot be changed.</p>
