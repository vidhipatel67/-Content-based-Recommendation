<p><br> Aside from the <code>java.util.Collection</code> interface, the Java JDK has the <code>java.util.Map</code> interface as well. It is sometimes also called an <i>Associated Array</i> or a <i>Dictionary</i>. A map defines key value mappings. Implementations of the Map interface do not contain collections of objects. Instead they contain collections of key-&gt;value mappings. It can be thought of as an array where the index doesn't need to be an integer.</p>
