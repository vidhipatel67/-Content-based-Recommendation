<p>Although a method signature has to be unique inside a class, the same method signature can be defined in different classes. If we define a method that exists in the super class then we override the super class method. It is called <i>method overriding</i>. This is different from method overloading. Method overloading happens with methods with the same name different signature. Method overriding happens with same name, same signature between inherited classes.</p>
