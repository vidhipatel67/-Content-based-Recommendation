<p>Also, the Event Model doesn't specify how it must be embedded within any program. So, while the model specifies that a call to an event handling method is a synchronous call, the Model does not prescribe that the event handling method cannot hand off tasks to another thread or that the entire event model implementation must run in the main thread of the application. In fact, the Java Platform's standard user interface framework (<a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Swing" title="Java Programming/Swing" class="mw-redirect">Swing</a>) includes an event handling implementation that runs as a complete subsystem of a desktop application, in its own thread.</p>
