<p>The <i>properties</i> of a bean are all private fields that are accessible and modifiable by public methods. These getter and setter methods should be marked as such by following a simple naming convention: for some property named, say, <code>xxx</code> there should be a <code>getXxx()</code> which returns the property value and a <code>setXxx()</code> which sets the property.</p>
