<p>In conventional applications, objects are assembled from the database before presenting to the end user. In JavaSpace applications, we keep the ready made "end user" objects and store them in the JavaSpace. In JavaSpace applications the services are decoupled from each other; they communicate through objects that they write and read/take from the JavaSpace. Services search for objects that they want to take or read from the Space by using template object.</p>
