<p>Java has the concepts of <b>cloning object</b>, and the end results are similar to copy constructor. Cloning an object is faster than creation with the <code><a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Keywords/new" title="Java Programming/Keywords/new"><font style="color:DodgerBlue4; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">new</font></a></code> keyword, because all the object memory is copied at once to destination cloned object. This is possible by implementing the <code>Cloneable</code> interface, which allows the method <code>Object.clone()</code> to perform a field-by-field copy.</p>
