<p>The <code>super()</code> command calls the constructor of the superclass. If there is no explicit call to <code>super(...)</code> or <code>this(...)</code>, then the default superclass constructor <code>super();</code> is called before the body of the constructor is executed. That said, there are instances where you need to add in the call manually. For example, if you write even one constructor, no matter what parameters it takes, the compiler will not add a default constructor.
