<p>If you kept the default settings for the setup installer wizard, your JDK should now be installed at <b>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_01</b>. You would require the location to your <b>bin</b> folder at a later time — this is located at <b>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_01\bin</b> It may be a hidden file, but no matter. Just don't use Program Files (x86)\ by mistake unless that's were installed Java.</p>
