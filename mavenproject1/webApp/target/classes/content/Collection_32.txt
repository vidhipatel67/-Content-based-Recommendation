<p>A set collection contains unique elements, so duplicates are not allowed. It is similar to a mathematical Set. When adding a new item to a set, the set calls the method <code>int hashCode()</code> of the item and compare it to the hash code of all the already inserted items. If the hash code has not been found, the item is added. If it is, the set now call the <code>boolean equals(Object obj);</code> method with all the set items. If all calls returns false, the item is inserted. If not, the item is not inserted.</p>
