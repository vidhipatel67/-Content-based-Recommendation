<p>The synchronization is always associated to an object. If the method is static, the associated object is the class. If the method is non-static, the associated object is the instance. While it is allowed to declare an <code><a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Keywords/abstract" title="Java Programming/Keywords/abstract"><font style="color:DodgerBlue4; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">abstract</font></a></code> method as <code><a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Keywords/synchronized" title="Java Programming/Keywords/synchronized"><font style="color:DodgerBlue4; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">synchronized</font></a></code>, it is meaningless to do so since synchronization is an aspect of the implementation, not the declaration, and abstract methods do not have an implementation.</p>
