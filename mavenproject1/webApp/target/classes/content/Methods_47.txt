<p>Same as the parameter passing, the method can return a primitive type or an object reference. So a method can return only one value. What if you want to return more than one value from a method. You can always pass in an object reference to the method, and let the method modify the object properties. The modified values can be considered as an output value from the method. However you can also create an Object array inside the method, assign the return values and return the array to the caller. You could have a problem however, if you want to mix primitive data types and object references as the output values from the method.</p>
