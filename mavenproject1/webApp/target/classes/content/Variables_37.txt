<p>The first instance, <code>firstName</code> is what we use as the names of variables. Remember though, <code>firstName</code> is not the same as <code>FirstName</code> because Java is <b>case-sensitive</b>. Case-sensitive basically implies that the case in which you wrote one word is the case you have to call that word in when using them later on. Anything other than that is not the same as you intended. You'll know more as you progress. You can hopefully tell now why the variables you were asked to identify weren't proper.</p>
