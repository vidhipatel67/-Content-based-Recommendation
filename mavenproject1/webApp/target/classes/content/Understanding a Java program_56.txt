<p>This method both computes the distance and prints it in one statement. The distance is computed with <code>point0.distance(point1)</code>; <code>distance()</code> is an instance method of the <code>java.awt.Point</code> class (of which <code>point0</code> and <code>point1</code> are instances). The method operates on <code>point0</code> (binding <code>this</code> to the object that <code>point0</code> refers to during the execution of the method) and accepting another Point as a parameter. Actually, it is slightly more complicated than that, but we'll explain later. The result of the <code>distance()</code> method is a double precision floating point number.</p>
