<p>Whitespace in Java is used to separate the tokens in a Java source file. Whitespace is required in some places, such as between <a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Scope" title="Java Programming/Scope">access modifiers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Primitive_Types" title="Java Programming/Primitive Types">type names</a> and Identifiers, and is used to improve readability elsewhere.</p>
