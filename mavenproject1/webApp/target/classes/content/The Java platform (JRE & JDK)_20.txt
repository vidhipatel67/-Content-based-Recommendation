<p>Quite possibly, the most important part of the JRE is the <b>Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</b>. The JVM acts like a <i>virtual</i> processor, enabling Java applications to be run on the local system. It's main purpose is to interpret (<i>read</i> translate) the received byte-code and make it appear as native code. The older Java architecture used this process of <b>interpretation</b> to execute Java byte-code. Even though the process of interpretation brought the WORA principle to diverse machines, it had a drawback — it consumed a lot of time and clocked the system processor intensively to load an application.</p>
