<p>You might think that accessing the private <code>memberVar</code> variable of <code>obj</code> would fail but as this is in the same class this code is legal. The <code>clone()</code> method copies the whole object's memory in one operation. This is much faster than using the new keyword. Object creation with the <code><a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Keywords/new" title="Java Programming/Keywords/new"><font style="color:DodgerBlue4; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">new</font></a></code> keyword is expensive, so if you need to create lots of objects with the same type, performance will be better if you create one object and clone new ones from it. See below a factory method that will return a new object using cloning.</p>
