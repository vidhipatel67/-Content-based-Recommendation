<p>The encoding used for the <code>NewStringUTF</code>, <code>GetStringUTFLength</code>, <code>GetStringUTFChars</code>, <code>ReleaseStringUTFChars</code>, <code>GetStringUTFRegion</code> functions is not standard UTF-8, but modified UTF-8. The null character (U+0000) and codepoints greater than or equal to U+10000 are encoded differently in modified UTF-8. Many programs actually use these functions incorrectly and treat the UTF-8 strings returned or passed into the functions as standard UTF-8 strings instead of modified UTF-8 strings. Programs should use the <code>NewString</code>, <code>GetStringLength</code>, <code>GetStringChars</code>, <code>ReleaseStringChars</code>, <code>GetStringRegion</code>, <code>GetStringCritical</code>, and <code>ReleaseStringCritical</code> functions, which use UTF-16LE encoding on little-endian architectures and UTF-16BE on big-endian architectures, and then use a UTF-16 to standard UTF-8 conversion routine.</p>
