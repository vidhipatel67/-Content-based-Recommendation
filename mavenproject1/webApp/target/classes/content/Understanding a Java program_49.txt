<p>While it is true that this class could be implemented in other ways, such as simply storing the coordinates of the two points and computing the distance as <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="\sqrt{(x_1-x_0)^2 + (y_1-y_0)^2}" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/d/3/5d313d187bb0a1e36ea37560b2c57f42.png">, this class instead uses the existing <code>java.awt.Point</code> class. This choice matches the abstract definition of this class: to print the distance between two points on the plane. We take advantage of existing behavior already implemented in the Java platform rather than implementing it again. We will see later how to make the program more flexible without adding much complexity, because we choose to use object abstractions here. However, the key point is that this class uses information hiding. That is, <i>how</i> the class stores its state or how it computes the distance is hidden. We can change this implementation without altering how clients use and invoke the class.</p>
