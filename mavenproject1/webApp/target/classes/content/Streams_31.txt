<p><code>System</code> is a class in the package <code>java.lang</code> with a number of static members that are available to Java programs. Two members that are useful for console output are <code>System.out</code> and <code>System.err</code>. Both System.out and System.err are <code>PrintStream</code> objects. <code>PrintStream</code> is a subclass of <code>FilterOutputStream</code>, itself a subclass of <code>OutputStream</code> (discussed above), and its main purpose is to translate a wide variety of data types into streams of bytes that represent that data in characters according to some encoding scheme.</p>
