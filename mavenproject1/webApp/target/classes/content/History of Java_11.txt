<p>The team started thinking of replacing C++ with a better version, a faster version, a responsive version. But the one thing they hadn't thought of, as of yet, was that the language they were aiming for had to be developed for an <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/embedded_system" class="extiw" title="w:embedded system">embedded system</a> with limited resources. An <b>embedded system</b> is a computer system scaled to a minimalistic interface demanding only a few functions from its design. For such a system, C++ or any successor would seem too large as all the languages at the time demanded a larger footprint than what was desired. The team thus had to think in a different way to go about solving all these problems.</p>
