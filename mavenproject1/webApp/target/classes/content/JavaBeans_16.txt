<p>The requirements for an object to be a bean is to define a public parameterless constructor, so that beans can be instantiated by builder tools in an uncomplicated way (In the Point bean, the parameterless constructor is given implicitly). Secondly, one of the interfaces <code>java.io.Serializable</code> or <code>java.io.Externalizable</code> need to be implemented. The interfaces do not prescribe the implementation of any methods, but are an approval, that the bean may be saved in persistent storage as in a file or database. In doing so, the bean can be restored after an application was shut down or transferred across networks. The ability to store state of a component in persistent storage is called <i>persistence</i>. Java offers a standard serialization mechanism, which makes it very easy to serialize objects. Alternatively, a component can be stored in a customized manner (e.g. in xml format) by implementing the <code>Externalizable</code> interface.</p>
