<p>Every object has two wait lists for threads associated with it. One wait list is used by the <code>synchronized</code> keyword to acquire the mutex lock associated with the object. If the mutex lock is currently held by another thread, the current thread is added to the list of blocked threads waiting on the mutex lock. The other wait list is used for signaling between threads accomplished through the <code>wait</code> and <code>notify</code> and <code>notifyAll</code> methods.</p>
