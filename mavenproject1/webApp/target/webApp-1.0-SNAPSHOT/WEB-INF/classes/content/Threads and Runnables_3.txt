<p><br> CPUs for any computer are designed to execute one task at <i>any given time</i>, yet we run multiple applications side-by-side and everything works in perfect congruence. It's not just because CPUs are extremely fast in performing calculations, it's because CPUs use a clever device of dividing their time amongst various tasks. Each application or task that is invoked on a computer gets associated with the CPU in the form of a <b>process</b>. A CPU therefore manages various processes, and jumps back and forth amongst each process giving it a fraction of its time and processing capability. This happens so fast that to a normal computer user it presents with the illusion of processes being run simultaneously. This capability of the CPU to divide its time amongst processes is called <b><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking" class="extiw" title="w:Computer multitasking">multitasking</a></b>.</p>
