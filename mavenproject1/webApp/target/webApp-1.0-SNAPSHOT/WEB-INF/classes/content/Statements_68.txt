<p>Here the condition is an expression. An expression as discussed earlier is any statement that returns a value. <code>While</code> condition statements evaluate to a boolean value, that is, either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. As long as the condition is <code>true</code>, the loop will iterate the block of code over and over and again. Once the condition evaluates to <code>false</code>, the loop exits to the next statement outside the loop.</p>
