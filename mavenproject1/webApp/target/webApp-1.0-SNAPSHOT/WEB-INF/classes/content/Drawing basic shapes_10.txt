<p>Now, we already know that a line is a connection of two discreet points atop a canvas. So, if one point is at <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="(x1,y1)" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/b/0/8b0689a1a576cb00380befde2bdd4865.png"> and the other is at <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="(x2,y2)" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/a/b/5ab7400cbfcbb4944df23b559034e83d.png">, drawing a line would require you to write a syntax like code below. For the sake of brevity, we will skim out the rest of the method unused in the example.</p>
