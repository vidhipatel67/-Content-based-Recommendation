<p>In the <a href="#code-section-31">code section 4.31</a>, the expression at line 3 is true if it is executed a morning and false if it is executed an afternoon. Thus, the instance of <code>obj</code> will be a <code>MyClass</code> or a <code>SubOfMyClass</code> depending on the execution time. So it is impossible to determine the method address at compile time. Because the <code>obj</code> reference can point to object and all its sub object, and that will be known only at runtime, a table is kept with all the possible method addresses to be called. Do not confuse:</p>
