<p>To complete writing native method, you need to process your class with <code>javah</code> tool that will generate a header code in C. You then need to provide implementation of the header code, produce dynamically loadable library (<code>.so</code> under Linux, <code>.dll</code> under Windows) and load it (in the simplest case with <code>System.load(library_file_name)</code> . The code completion is trivial if only primitive types like integers are passed but gets more complex if it is needed to exchange strings or objects from the C code. In general, everything can be on C level, including creation of the new objects and calling back methods, written in java.</p>
