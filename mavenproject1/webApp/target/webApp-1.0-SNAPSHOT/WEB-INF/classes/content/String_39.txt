<p>The difference between the above and below code is that the above code checks to see if the <code>String</code>'s are the same objects in memory which they are. This is as a result of the fact that <code>String</code>'s are stored in a place in memory called the String Constant Pool. If the <code>new</code> keyword is not explicitly used when creating the <code>String</code> it checks to see if it already exists in the Pool and uses the existing one. If it does not exist, a new Object is created. This is what allows Strings to be immutable in Java. To test for equality, use the <code>equals(Object)</code> method inherited by every class and defined by <code>String</code> to return <code><a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Literals/Boolean_Literals/true" title="Java Programming/Literals/Boolean Literals/true"><font style="color:DodgerBlue4; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">true</font></a></code> if and only if the object passed in is a <code>String</code> containing the exact same data:</p>
