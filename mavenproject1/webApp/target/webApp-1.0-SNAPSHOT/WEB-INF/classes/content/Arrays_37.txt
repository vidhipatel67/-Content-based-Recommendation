<p><code>i</code> will be the indexes of the main array and <code>j</code> will be the indexes of all the sub-arrays. We have to first iterate on the main array. We have to read the size of the array. Then we iterate on each sub-array. We have to read the size of each array as it may vary. Doing so, we iterate on all the sub-array items using the indexes. All the items will be read in the right order.</p>
