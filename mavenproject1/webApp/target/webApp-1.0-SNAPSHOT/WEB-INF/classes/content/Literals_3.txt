<p>Java <b>Literals</b> are syntactic representations of boolean, character, numeric, or string data. Literals provide a means of expressing specific values in your program. For example, in the following statement, an integer variable named <code>count</code> is declared and assigned an integer value. The literal <code><b>0</b></code> represents, naturally enough, the value zero.</p>
