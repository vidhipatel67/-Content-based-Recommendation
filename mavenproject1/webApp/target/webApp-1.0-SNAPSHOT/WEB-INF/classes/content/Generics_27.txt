<p>As we have seen above, generics give the impression that a new container type is created with each different type parameter. We have also seen that in addition to the normal type checking, the type parameter has to match as well when we assign generics variables. In some cases this is too restrictive. What if we would like to relax this additional checking? What if we would like to define a collection variable that can hold any generic collection, regardless of the parameter type it holds? The wildcard type is represented by the character <b>&lt;?&gt;</b>, and pronounced <b>Unknown</b>, or <b>Any-Type</b>. Any-Type can be expressed also by <code>&lt;? extends Object&gt;</code>.
