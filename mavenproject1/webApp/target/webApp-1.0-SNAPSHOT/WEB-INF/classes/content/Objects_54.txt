<p>The <code>java.lang.Object.hashCode()</code> method returns an integer (<code>int</code>). This integer can be used to distinguish objects although not completely. It quickly separates most of the objects and those with the same <i>hash code</i> are separated later in another way. It is used by the classes that provide associative arrays, for instance, those that implement the <code>java.util.Map</code> interface . They use the <i>hash code</i> to store the object in the associative array. A good <code>hashCode</code> implementation will return a hash code:</p>
