<p>The <a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Generics" title="Java Programming/Generics">Generics</a> has been added since JDK version 1.5. It is an enhancement to the type system of the Java language. All collection implementations since 1.5 now have one <i>parameterized type &lt;E&gt;</i> added. The <i>E</i> refers to an <i>Element</i> type. When a collection is created, the actual <i>Element type</i> will replace the E. In the collection, the objects are now upcasted to <i>E</i> class.</p>
