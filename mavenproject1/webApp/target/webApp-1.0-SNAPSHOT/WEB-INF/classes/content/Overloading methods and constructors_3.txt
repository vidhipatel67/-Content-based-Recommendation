<p>In a class, there can be several methods with the same name. However they must have a different <i>signature</i>. The signature of a method is comprised of its name, its parameter types and the order of its parameter. The signature of a method is <b>not</b> comprised of its return type nor its visibility nor its exceptions it may throw. The practice of defining two or more methods within the same class that shares the same names but different parameters is called <i>overloading methods</i>.</p>
