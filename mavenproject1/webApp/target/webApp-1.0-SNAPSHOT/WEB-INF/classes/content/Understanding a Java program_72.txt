<p>Both the <code>main()</code> and <code>intValue()</code> methods are <i>static methods</i>. The <code><a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Keywords/static" title="Java Programming/Keywords/static"><font style="color:DodgerBlue4; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">static</font></a></code> keyword tells the compiler to create a single memory space associated with the class. Each individual object instantiated has its own private state variables and methods but use the same <b>static</b> methods and members common to the single class object created by the compiler when the first class object is instantiated or created. This means that the method executes in a static or non-object context — there is no implicit separate instance available when the static methods run from various objects, and the special variable <code>this</code> is not available. As such, static methods cannot access instance methods or instance fields (such as <code>printDistance()</code>) or <code>point0</code>) directly. The <code>main()</code> method can only invoke the instance method <code>printDistance()</code> method via an instance reference such as <code>dist</code>.</p>
