<p>Output Streams direct streams of bytes outwards to the environment from our program or application. <code>OutputStream</code> is an abstract class which is the destination counterpart of <code>InputStream</code>. <code>OutputStream</code> has a <code>write()</code> method which can be used to write a byte to the stream. The method is overloaded, and can take an array as well. A <code>close()</code> method closes the stream when the application is finished with it, and it has a <code>flush()</code> method. The stream may wait until it has a certain amount before it writes it all at once for efficiency. If the stream object is buffering any data before writing it, the <code>flush()</code> method will force it to write all of this data. Like <code>InputStream</code>, this class cannot be instantiated, but has concrete subclasses that parallel those of <code>InputStream</code>, eg <code>ByteArrayOutputStream</code>, <code>FileOutputStream</code>, etc.</p>
