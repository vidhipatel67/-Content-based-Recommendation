<p>Applets are used to provide interactive features to web applications that cannot be provided by <a href="/wiki/HTML" title="HTML" class="mw-redirect">HTML</a>. Since Java's bytecode is platform independent, Java applets can be executed by browsers for many platforms, including Windows, Unix, Mac OS and Linux. There are open source tools like applet2app which can be used to convert an applet to a stand alone Java application/windows executable. This has the advantage of running a Java applet in off-line mode without the need for Internet browser software.</p>
