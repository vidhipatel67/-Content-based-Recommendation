<p>Java has various inbuilt streams implemented as classes in the package <code>java.io</code> like the classes of <code>System.in</code> and <code>System.out</code>. Streams can be classed as both input and output streams. All Java streams are derived from Input Stream (<code>java.io.InputStream</code>) and Output Stream (<code>java.io.OutputStream</code>) classes. They are abstract base classes meant for other stream classes. The <code>System.in</code> is the input stream class derivative and analogically <code>System.out</code> is the output counterpart. Both are basic classes used to directly interact with input and output through console, similarly follows <code>System.err</code>. Also Java has streams to communicate across different parts of a program or even among threads. There are also classes that "filter" streams, changing one format to another (e.g. class <code>DataOutputStream</code>, which translates various primitive types to byte streams).</p>
