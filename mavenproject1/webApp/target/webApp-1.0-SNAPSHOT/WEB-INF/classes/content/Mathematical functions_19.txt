<p>The three main trigonometric methods are <code>Math.<b>sin</b>(x)</code>, <code>Math.<b>cos</b>(x)</code>, and <code>Math.<b>tan</b>(x)</code>, which are used to find the sine, cosine, and tangent, respectively, of any given number. So, for example, a call to <code>Math.sin(Math.PI/2)</code> would return a value of about 1. Although methods for finding the cosecant, secant, and cotangent are not available, these values can be found by taking the reciprocal of the sine, cosine, and tangent, respectively. For example, the cosecant of pi/2 could be found using <code>1/Math.sin(Math.PI/2)</code>.</p>
