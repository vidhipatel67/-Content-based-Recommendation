<p>It should be noted that the execution of the <code>Thread</code> didn't occur in the desired order. Instead of the order <code>t1</code>–<code>t2</code>–<code>t3</code>, the threads executed in the order of <code>t1</code>–<code>t3</code>–<code>t2</code>. The order in which the threads are executed is completely dependant on the operating system and may change for every execution of the program, thus making output of multithreaded application difficult to predict and control. Some people suggest that this is the major reason that adds to the complexity of multithreaded programming and its debugging. However, it should be observed that once the threads were put to sleep using the <code>Thread.sleep(...)</code> function, the execution intervals and order can be predicted quite capably. The thread with the least amount of sleeping time was <code>t2</code> (<code>"Thread-2"</code>) with <code>189</code> milliseconds of sleep hence it got called first. Then <code>t1</code> was called and finally <code>t3</code> was called.</p>
