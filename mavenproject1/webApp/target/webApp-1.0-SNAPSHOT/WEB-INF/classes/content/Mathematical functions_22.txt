<p>To convert between degree and radian measures of angles, two methods are available, <code>Math.<b>toRadians</b>(x)</code> and <code>Math.<b>toDegrees</b>(x)</code>. While using <code>Math.toRadians(x)</code>, a degrees value must be passed in, and that value in radians (the degree value multiplied by pi/180) will be returned. The <code>Math.toDegrees(x)</code> method takes in a value in radians and the value in degrees (the radian value multiplied by 180/pi) is returned.</p>
