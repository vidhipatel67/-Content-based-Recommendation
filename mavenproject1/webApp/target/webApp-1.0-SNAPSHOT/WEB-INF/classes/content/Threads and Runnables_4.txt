<p>So, if we run a Java application on a computer, we are effectively creating a process with the CPU that gets a fraction of the CPU's time. In Java parlance, this main process gets called the <b><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computer_software)" class="extiw" title="w:Daemon (computer software)">daemon</a> process</b> or the <b>daemon thread</b>. But, Java goes one step further. It allows programmers to divide this daemon thread into several multiple threads which get executed simultaneously (much like a CPU) hence providing a Java application with a finer multitasking capability called <b><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading" class="extiw" title="w:Multithreading">multithreading</a></b>.</p>
