<p>The elements of arrays are accessed with integer indices. The first element of an array is always element 0. This program accesses the first four elements of the <code>args</code> array explicitly with the indices 0, 1, 2, and 3. This program does <i>not</i> perform any input validation, such as verifying that the user passed at least four arguments to the program. We will fix that later.</p>
