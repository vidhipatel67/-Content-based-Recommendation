<p>In the <a href="#code-section-14">code section 6.14</a> we want to create the <code>Person</code> inside the if-else, but we also want to return the object reference to the caller, so we need to create the object reference outside of the if-else, because of the <a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Scope" title="Java Programming/Scope">scoping rule</a> in Java. Incorrect error-handling and poor contract design can be a pitfall with any programming language. This is also true for Java.</p>
