<p>There is also <code>Writer</code> which is a character counterpart of <code>OutputStream</code>, and a destination counterpart to Reader, this is also an abstract superclass. Particular implementations parallel those of Reader, eg <code>FileWriter</code>, <code>StringWriter</code>, and <code>OutputStreamWriter</code>, for converting a regular <code>OutputStream</code> into a reader so that it can take character data.</p>
