<p>There is also <code>Reader</code> which is an abstract class that represents a source of character data. It is analogous to <code>InputStream</code>, except that it deals with characters instead of bytes (remember that Java uses Unicode, so that a character is 2 bytes, not one). Its methods are generally similar to those of <code>InputStream</code>. Concrete subclasses include classes like <code>FileReader</code>, which reads characters from files, and <code>StringReader</code>, which reads characters from strings. You can also convert an <code>InputStream</code> object to a Reader object with the <code>InputStreamReader</code> class, which can be "wrapped around" an <code>InputStream</code> object (by passing it as an argument in its constructor). It uses a character encoding scheme (which can be changed by the programmer) to translate a byte into a 16-bit Unicode character.</p>
