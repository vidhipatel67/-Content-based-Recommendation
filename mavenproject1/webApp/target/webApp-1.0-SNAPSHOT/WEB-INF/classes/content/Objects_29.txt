<p>In the car analogy, the created car may have different <b>Type</b> of drivers. We create separate user manuals for them, Average user manual, Power user manual, Child user manual, or Handicapped user manual. Each type of user manual describes only those features/operations appropriate for the type of driver. The Power driver may have additional gears to switch to higher speeds, that are not available to other type of users...</p>
