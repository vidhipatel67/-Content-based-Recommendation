<p>Creating threads is as simple as the above program suggests. You just have to create an object of the <code>Thread</code> class and pass a reference to a <code>Runnable</code> process object. In the case above, we present the <code>Thread</code> constructor with the class object for the <code>RunnableProcess</code> class that we created in <a href="#code-listing-1">code listing 1</a>. But for each object, we give a different name (i.e., <code>"Thread-1"</code> and <code>"Thread-2"</code>, etc.) to differentiate between the three <code>Thread</code> objects. The above example only declares <code>Thread</code> objects and hasn't yet started them for execution.</p>
