<p>The Java JDK collection implementations are quite powerful and good, so it is unlikely that you will need to write your own. The usage of the different collections are the same but the implementations are different. If the existing collection implementations do not meet your needs, you can write your version of the implementation. Your version of the implementation just needs to implement the same <code>java.util.Collection</code> interface, then you can switch to using your implementation and the code that is using the collection does not need to be changed.</p>
