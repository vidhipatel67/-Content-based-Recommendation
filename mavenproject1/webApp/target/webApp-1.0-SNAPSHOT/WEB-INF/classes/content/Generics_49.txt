<p>Since Java 1.5, the class <code>java.lang.Class</code> is generic. It is an interesting example of using generics for something other than a container class. For example, the type of String.class is <code>Class&lt;String&gt;</code>, and the type of Serializable.class is <code>Class&lt;Serializable&gt;</code>. This can be used to improve the type safety of your reflection code. In particular, since the <code>newInstance()</code> method in Class now returns T, you can get more precise types when creating objects reflectively. Now we can use the <code>newInstance()</code> method to return a new object with exact type, without casting. An example with generics:</p>
