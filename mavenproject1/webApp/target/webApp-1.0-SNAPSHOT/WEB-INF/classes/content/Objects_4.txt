<p>For example, a sports car is an object. Some of its fields might be its height, weight, acceleration, and speed. An object's fields just hold data about that object. Some of the methods of the sports car could be "drive", "park", "race", etc. The methods really don't mean much unless associated with the sports car, and the same goes for the fields.</p>
