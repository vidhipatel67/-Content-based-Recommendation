<p>When you tell a program you need to use an integer, say even a <code>byte</code>, the Java program allocates a space in the memory. It allocates whole 8 bits of memory. Where it wouldn't seem to matter for today's memory modules that have place for almost a dozen trillion such bits, it matters in other cases. Once allocated that part of the memory gets used and can only be claimed back after the operation is finished. Consider a complicated Java program where the only data type you'd be using would be <code>long</code> integers. What happens when there's no space for more memory allocation jobs? Ever heard of the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_overflow" class="extiw" title="w:Stack overflow">Stack Overflow errors</a>. That's exactly what happens — your memory gets completely used up and fast. So, choose your data types with extreme caution.</p>
