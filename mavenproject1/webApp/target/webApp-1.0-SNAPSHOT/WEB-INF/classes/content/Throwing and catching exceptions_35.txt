<p>A <code><a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Keywords/finally" title="Java Programming/Keywords/finally"><font style="color:DodgerBlue4; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">finally</font></a></code> block can be added after the <code>catch</code> blocks. A <code>finally</code> block is always executed, even when no exception is thrown, an exception is thrown and caught, or an exception is thrown and not caught. It's a place to put code that should always be executed after an unsafe operation like a file close or a database disconnection. You can define a <code>try</code> block without <code>catch</code> block, however, in this case, it must be followed by a <code>finally</code> block.</p>
