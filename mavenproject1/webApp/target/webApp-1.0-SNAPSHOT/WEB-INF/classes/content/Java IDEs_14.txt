<p>BlueJ offers an interesting GUI for creation of packages and programs. Classes are represented as boxes with arrows running between them to represent inheritance/implementation or if on is constructed in another. The source code is generated by the <a href="/wiki/Introduction_to_Software_Engineering/UML" title="Introduction to Software Engineering/UML">UML diagram</a> or vice-versa. BlueJ adds all those classes (the project) into the classpath at compile time.</p>
