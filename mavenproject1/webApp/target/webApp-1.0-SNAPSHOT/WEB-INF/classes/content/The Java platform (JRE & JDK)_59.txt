<p>In most modern operating systems, a large body of reusable code is provided to simplify the programmer's job. This code is typically provided as a set of <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computer_science)#Dynamic_linking" class="extiw" title="w:Library (computer science)">dynamically loadable libraries</a> that applications can call at runtime. Because the Java platform is not dependent on any specific operating system, applications cannot rely on any of the existing libraries. Instead, the Java platform provides a comprehensive set of standard class libraries, containing much of the same reusable functions commonly found in modern operating systems.</p>
