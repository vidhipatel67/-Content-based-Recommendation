<p>You can throw any type of <b>Throwable</b> object using the keyword <code><a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Keywords/throw" title="Java Programming/Keywords/throw"><font style="color:DodgerBlue4; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">throw</font></a></code>. It interrupts the method. Anything after the <b>throw</b> statement would not be executed, unless the <i>thrown</i> exception is <a href="#Exception_handlers">handled</a>. The exception object is not <i>returned</i> from the method, it is <i>thrown</i> from the method. That means that the exception object is not the return value of the method and the calling method can be interrupted too and so on and so on...</p>
