<p><br> An <b>object</b> is composed of <b>fields</b> and <b>methods</b>. The fields, also called <i>data members</i>, <i>characteristics</i>, <i>attributes</i>, or <i>properties</i>, describe the state of the object. The methods generally describe the actions associated with a particular object. Think of an object as a noun, its fields as adjectives describing that noun, and its methods as the verbs that can be performed by or on that noun.</p>
