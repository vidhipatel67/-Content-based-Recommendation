<p>In addition to the try and catch blocks, a <code><a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Keywords/finally" title="Java Programming/Keywords/finally"><font style="color:DodgerBlue4; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">finally</font></a></code> block may be present. The finally block is always executed, even if an exception is thrown. It may appear with or without a catch block, but always with a try block.</p>
