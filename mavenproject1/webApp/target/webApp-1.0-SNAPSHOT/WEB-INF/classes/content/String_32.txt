<p>To avoid unnecessary memory use like this, use the <code>StringBuilder</code> class. It provides similar functionality to <code><strong class="selflink">String</strong></code>s, but stores its data in a mutable way. Only one <code>StringBuilder</code> object is created. Also because object creation is time consuming, using <code>StringBuilder</code> produces much faster code.</p>
