<p>Further, as of release 1.4, many general purpose Throwable classes (for example <code>Exception</code>, <code>RuntimeException</code>, <code>Error</code>) have been retrofitted with constructors that take a cause. This was not strictly necessary, due to the existence of the <code>initCause</code> method, but it is more convenient and expressive to delegate to a constructor that takes a cause.</p>
