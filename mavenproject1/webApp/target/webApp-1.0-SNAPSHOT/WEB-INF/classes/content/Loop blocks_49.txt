<p>In the <a href="#code-section-34">code section 3.34</a>, the loop would print out all the numbers from 1 to 10, but we have a check for when <code>i</code> equals 5. When the loop reaches its fifth iteration, it will be cut short by the <code>break</code> statement, at which point it will exit the loop.</p>
