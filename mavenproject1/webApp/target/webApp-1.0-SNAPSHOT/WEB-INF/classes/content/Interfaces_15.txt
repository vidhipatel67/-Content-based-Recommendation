<p>You can also have this interest using a common super class but a class can only inherit from one super class whereas it can implement several interfaces. Java does not support full orthogonal multiple inheritance. Java does not allow you to create a subclass from two classes. Multiple inheritance in <a href="/wiki/C%2B%2B" title="C++" class="mw-redirect">C++</a> has complicated rules to disambiguate fields and methods inherited from multiple superclasses and types inherited multiple times. By separating interface from implementation, interfaces offer much of the benefit of multiple inheritance with less complexity and ambiguity. The price of no multiple inheritance is some code redundancy; since interfaces only define the signature of a class but cannot contain any implementation, every class inheriting an interface must provide the implementation of the defined methods, unlike in pure multiple inheritance, where the implementation is also inherited. The major benefit of that is that all Java objects can have a common ancestor. That class is called <code><a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/API/java.lang.Object" title="Java Programming/API/java.lang.Object">Object</a></code>. When overriding methods defined in interfaces there are several rules to be followed:</p>
