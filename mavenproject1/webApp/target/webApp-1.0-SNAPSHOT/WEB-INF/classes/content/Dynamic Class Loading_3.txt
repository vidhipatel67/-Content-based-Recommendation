<p>Dynamic Class Loading allows the loading of java code that is not known about before a program starts. Many classes rely on other classes and resources such as icons which make loading a single class unfeasible. For this reason the <code>ClassLoader</code> (<code>java.lang.ClassLoader</code>) is used to manage all the inner dependencies of a collection of classes. The Java model loads classes as needed and doesn't need to know the name of all classes in a collection before any one of its classes can be loaded and run.</p>
