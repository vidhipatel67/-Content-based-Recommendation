<p><br> In Java, programs are not compiled into executable files; they are compiled into <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode" class="extiw" title="w:Bytecode">bytecode</a> (as discussed <a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/The_Java_Platform" title="Java Programming/The Java Platform">earlier</a>), which the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) then executes at runtime. Java source code is compiled into bytecode when we use the <code>javac</code> compiler. The bytecode gets saved on the disk with the file extension <code>.class</code>. When the program is to be run, the bytecode is converted, using the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compiliation" class="extiw" title="w:Just-in-time compiliation">just-in-time</a> (JIT) compiler. The result is machine code which is then fed to the memory and is executed.</p>
