<p>Both <code>Math.random()</code> and the <code>Random</code> class produce pseudorandom numbers. This is good enough for a lot of applications, but remember that it is not <i>truly</i> random. If you want a more secure random number generator, Java provides the <code>java.security.SecureRandom</code> package. What happens with <code>Math.random()</code> and the <code>Random</code> class is that a 'seed' is chosen from which the pseudorandom numbers are generated. <code>SecureRandom</code> increases the security to ensure that the seed which is used by the pseudorandom number generator is non-deterministic — that is, you cannot simply put the machine in the same state to get the same set of results. Once you have created a <code>SecureRandom</code> instance, you can use it in the same way as you can the <code>Random</code> class.</p>
