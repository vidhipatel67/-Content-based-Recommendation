<p>A class can implement several interface, separated by a comma. Java interfaces behave much like the concept of the <a href="/wiki/Objective-C_Programming" title="Objective-C Programming">Objective-C</a> protocol. It is recommended to name an interface <code><i>&lt;verb&gt;</i>able</code>, to mean the type of action this interface would enable on a class. However, it is not recommended to start the name of an interface by <code>I</code> as in <a href="/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming" title="C++ Programming">C++</a>. It is useless. Your IDE will help you instead.</p>
