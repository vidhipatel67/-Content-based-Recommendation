<p>Programming may not be as trivial or boring as just crunching huge numbers any more. However, huge chunks of code written in any programming language today, let alone Java, obsessively deal with numbers. Be it churning out huge prime numbers,<sup id="cite_ref-note-1_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-note-1-1">[1]</a></sup> or just calculating a cost of emission from your scooter. In 1965, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_5" class="extiw" title="w:Gemini 5">Gemini V</a> space mission escaped a near-fatal accident because of a programming error.<sup id="cite_ref-note-2_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-note-2-2">[2]</a></sup> And again in 1979, a computer program calculated the ability of five nuclear reactors to withstand earthquakes as overestimated; this caused the plants to be shut down temporarily.<sup id="cite_ref-note-3_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-note-3-3">[3]</a></sup> There is one thing common to both these programming errors: the subject data, being computed at the time the errors occurred, was numeric. Out of past experience, Java came bundled with revised type checking for numeric data and puts lots of emphasis on correctly identifying different types of it. So you must recognise the importance of numeric data when it comes to programming.</p>
