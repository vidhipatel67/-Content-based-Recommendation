<p>When an object from the <code>MyObject</code> class is created for the first time, the JVM searches the file system for the definition of the class, that is the Java byte code. The file has the extension of <code>*.class</code>. The <b>CLASSPATH</b> environment variable contains locations where Java classes are stored. The JVM is looking for the <code>MyObject.class</code> file. Depending on which package the class belongs to, the package name will be translated to a directory path.</p>
