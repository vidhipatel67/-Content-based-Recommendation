<p>If you need to call methods between different language environments, use <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Object_Request_Broker_Architecture" class="extiw" title="w:Common Object Request Broker Architecture">CORBA</a>. With <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Object_Request_Broker_Architecture" class="extiw" title="w:Common Object Request Broker Architecture">CORBA</a> a Java client can call C++ server and/or a C++ client can call a Java server. With RMI that can not be done.</p>
