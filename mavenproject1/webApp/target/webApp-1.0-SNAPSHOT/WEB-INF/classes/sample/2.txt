text:I was presented with this question in an end of module open book exam today and found myself lost. i was reading Head first Java and both definitions seemed to be exactly the same. i was just wondering what the MAIN difference was for my own piece of mind. i know there are a number of similar questions to this but, none i have seen which provide a definitive answer.Thanks, Darren
